# Tamagachi Clone Prototype

This is the main branch for the prototype of my tamagachi clone!

At this stage a gameloop has been created that updated attributes in a lifecycle() method every 5 seconds. If HP
reaches zero the creature dies. An additional interaction is avaiulble to allow the creature to sleep and recover fatigue.
